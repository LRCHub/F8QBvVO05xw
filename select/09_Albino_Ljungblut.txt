In a room with you,
Tables turned.
Chinese dolls with sad eyes,
Looking trough me.

Let's drink ourselves oblivious,
So we won't remember this.
Let's drink ourselves oblivious,
So we won't remember.

You can know somebody
Without knowing them at all.
But you can not win what lies within,
Then you lose the love you choose.
